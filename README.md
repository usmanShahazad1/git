Git and GitHub
Let’s start with the basics. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others. It is used to manage the history of your code and to merge changes from different branches. I can understand that as of now these terms like version control, branches, and merges are not familiar to you. But don’t worry, we will learn them in this tutorial.

Git and Github are different
Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to your files. It is a free and open-source software that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember, GIT is a software and can be installed on your computer.

Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you to store and share your code with others. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on projects and to share code. It is not that Github is the only provider of Git repositories, but it is one of the most popular ones.

A little on version control systems
Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your files and to collaborate with others. Version control systems are essential for software development. Consider version control as a checkpoint in game. You can move to any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.
